# Contributing to PingTidy

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PingTidy as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github Flow
We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Javascript/Typescript).

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any questions?
Feel free to open an issue to discuss.
